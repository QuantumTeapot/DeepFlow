# Bulldozer Price Prediction 

## Overview

This repository features one end-to-end data science project completed as part of my coursework and self-learning:

- **Bulldozer Price Prediction** – Built a machine learning model to predict the sale prices of bulldozers at auctions using historical data.

This project demonstrates key skills in **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **machine learning modeling** using Python.


## Bulldozer Price Prediction

Used historical auction data to build a model predicting bulldozer sale prices.

### Key Steps:
- Cleaned and preprocessed auction data (handled missing values, fixed data types).
- Parsed `saledate` to extract features like year, month, and day.
- Encoded categorical features.
- Trained a **Random Forest Regressor** for price prediction.
- Achieved a validation **RMSLE of 0.2154**.
- Generated predictions for the test set in the required format.
